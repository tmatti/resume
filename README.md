## Professional Experience
### Stord

It is very difficult to sum up my contributions to Stord in a few bullet points. I joined the company very early and helped develop key features of their original POC in Ruby on Rails. The company quickly rocket shipped to unicorn status and we started building the Cloud Supply Chain. We got to work building an OMS (Order Management System) with an event driven micro-service architecture. The services were written in Elixir with the Phoenix framework and communicated with HTTP and Kafka. The OMS integrated upstream with ecomm platforms like Shopify and downstream with WMSes (Warehouse Management Systems) like Logiwa and our own which we called S1W. I was a top contributor to the fulfillment layer of the OMS and was promoted to Senior Software Engineer as a result. As a senior, I led the development of several features including a complex solution to a critical bug that had cost the company $750k+. A major customer credited this fix with their decision to extend their contract.

In January of 2023, I switched to the WMS team where I built critical features that helped Stord deprecate multiple external vendors saving the company millions of dollars. One of these features was an efficient order picking module that increased operational efficiency by ~50% compared to a vendors solution. As a team we managed to reach feature parity with every other WMS in the Stord Network which allowed Stord to migrate the entire network to our product. This increased the overall efficiency of the fulfillment network and allowed Stord to stop paying additional vendors, saving millions.
