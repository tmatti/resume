## Professional Experience
### Stord

At Stord, I made significant contributions from the outset, including developing key features like lot tracking and a multi-step order form for the original application. During our pivot to building a cloud supply chain, I played a crucial role in constructing a world-class Order Management System (OMS) from the ground up. I was a top contributor to the OMS from day one. When the business shifted its focus to investing in a Warehouse Management System (WMS), I joined the WMS team, where I developed essential features that enabled Stord to transition 100% of its fulfillment network to our software, significantly boosting operational efficiency in warehouses nationwide.
